# 🚀 Jenkins Complete Interview Guide (2 Years DevOps Experience)

This file combines **detailed Q&A explanations** and a **short revision cheat sheet** — perfect for your final interview preparation.

## 🧩 1. What is CI/CD and What Tools Are Used?
**Detailed Answer:**
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** focuses on building and testing code automatically whenever developers push changes.  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** ensures that every build is ready for deployment at any time.  
- **Continuous Deployment** goes one step further and automatically deploys after tests pass.

**Tools Used:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps.

**Project Example:**  
In my Java project, Jenkins was used as the main CI/CD tool — it built the application using Maven, ran SonarQube for code quality checks, uploaded artifacts to Nexus, and deployed WAR files to Tomcat using Ansible automation.

---

## 🧩 2. What is a Jenkins Agent/Node?
**Detailed Answer:**
A **Jenkins agent** (or node) is where the actual Jenkins job runs.  
It helps in distributing workload from the **master (controller)**, allowing multiple jobs to run in parallel.  

Agents can be:  
- Physical or Virtual Machines  
- Docker containers (Docker agent setup)  

**Project Example:**  
In my setup, the Jenkins master used a **Docker-based agent** where the container included Java, Maven, and Ansible. This containerized agent executed all build and deployment stages, ensuring consistency and faster provisioning compared to traditional VM slaves.

**Short Summary:** Jenkins agents are worker nodes that execute jobs, reducing the load on the controller.

---

## 🧩 3. What is a Jenkins Workspace?
**Detailed Answer:**
A **workspace** is the directory on an agent or master where Jenkins clones the source code and runs the job files.  
Each pipeline or job has its own isolated workspace to avoid file conflicts.

**Troubleshooting Tip:**  
When builds fail due to old files or uncommitted changes, run `cleanWs()` or manually wipe the workspace.

**Short Summary:** Jenkins workspace is where each build executes and stores temporary files/logs.

---

## 🧩 4. How Do You Manage Secrets in Jenkins?
**Detailed Answer:**
Jenkins uses the **Credentials Plugin** to store secrets like passwords, tokens, SSH keys, and AWS credentials securely.  
Credentials are encrypted and stored inside Jenkins, and can be used inside pipelines using the `withCredentials()` block.

```groovy
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'sonar_token', variable: 'SONAR_TOKEN')]) {
  sh 'mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN'
}
```

In advanced setups, Jenkins integrates with **HashiCorp Vault** or **GCP Secret Manager** for external secret retrieval at runtime.

**Short Summary:** Secrets are managed via Jenkins credentials or integrated vaults for better security.

---

## 🧩 5. Difference Between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines
**Detailed Answer:**
- **Declarative Pipeline:** Simple, YAML-like structure using `pipeline {}` syntax. Easier to maintain.  
- **Scripted Pipeline:** Written in Groovy inside `node {}` blocks. Provides flexibility and advanced logic.

**Project Example:**  
I used **Scripted Pipelines** since it allowed better control for Terraform/Ansible orchestration and custom approvals.

**Short Summary:** Declarative = simpler & readable; Scripted = flexible & programmable.

---

## 🧩 6. Jenkins Integration with Docker
**Detailed Answer:**
Jenkins integrates with Docker in two main ways:
1. Using **Docker agents** to run jobs inside lightweight containers.
2. Using Docker commands in the pipeline to **build, tag, and push** images.

**Example:**
```groovy
stage('Docker Build & Push') {
  steps {
    sh 'docker build -t myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
    sh 'docker push repo/myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
  }
}
```

**Project Example:**  
I used a Docker agent to run Jenkins builds and push containerized Java applications to DockerHub for EKS deployment.

**Short Summary:** Docker agents run Jenkins builds in containers; Docker commands deploy containerized apps.

---

## 🧩 7. How Do You Connect Jenkins to Git?
**Detailed Answer:**
- Add the **Git plugin** in Jenkins.  
- Under *Source Code Management*, specify the **Git repository URL** and credentials.  
- For automatic builds, configure a **GitHub webhook** that triggers Jenkins on each commit or PR merge.

**Project Example:**  
In my multibranch pipeline, webhooks automatically triggered builds when developers merged PRs to `develop` or `main` branches.

**Short Summary:** Connect Jenkins to Git via SCM settings and webhooks for automatic triggering.

---

## 🧩 8. What is a Jenkins Workspace Conflict and How Do You Resolve It?
**Detailed Answer:**
A workspace conflict occurs when Jenkins detects uncommitted changes, leftover files, or permission issues from a previous build.  

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check **console output** for detailed error.  
2. Run **“Wipe Out Workspace”** manually or use `cleanWs()` in pipeline.  
3. Ensure Git repository access and branch permissions are correct.

**Short Summary:** Use `cleanWs()` or workspace cleanup plugin to resolve build conflicts.

---

## 🧩 9. Jenkins + Terraform + Ansible Integration (Infra + Config)
**Detailed Answer:**
- Terraform handles infrastructure provisioning.  
- Ansible configures software post-deployment.  
- Jenkins orchestrates both tools through parameterized stages.

**Pipeline Flow Example:**
```groovy
parameters {
  choice(name: 'ACTION', choices: ['apply', 'destroy', 'skip'], description: 'Terraform action')
  choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['dev', 'prod'], description: 'Environment')
}
```

- Terraform stage executes `init`, `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy`.  
- Ansible stage executes `ansible-playbook` only when infra exists or `ACTION == "skip"`.

**Approval Step:**
```groovy
input message: 'Approve Terraform Apply?'
```

**Short Summary:** Jenkins controls Terraform + Ansible using parameters and approvals for automated, safe deployments.

---

## 🧩 10. How Do You Handle Failed Deployments?
**Detailed Answer:**
1. **Check console logs** for the failed stage.  
2. Verify **Nexus artifact** version and file integrity.  
3. Confirm **target server connectivity** (SSH, ping).  
4. Check **Tomcat logs** and service status:
   ```bash
   systemctl status tomcat
   tail -f /opt/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
   ```
5. Re-run the pipeline after cleanup.

**Short Summary:** Review logs, check connectivity, verify artifact, restart Tomcat, re-run job.

---

## 🧩 11. Common Jenkins Best Practices
1. Use **Declarative pipelines** for simplicity and Scripted for advanced logic.  
2. Maintain Jenkinsfiles in **Git repositories**.  
3. Use **credentials plugin** for secret management.  
4. **Clean workspace** after each build (`cleanWs()`).  
5. Add **email/Slack alerts** for success/failure.  
6. Use **parameterized pipelines** for flexibility.  
7. Always verify **Terraform Apply** with approvals.  
8. Store artifacts in **Nexus/S3** for reusability.  
9. Use **Docker agents** for consistent build environments.  
10. Review **SonarQube reports** for code quality.
